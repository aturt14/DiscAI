# DiscAI

DiscAI is a simple command-line tool able to create conversations with two ollama models. The main idea behind this is to be able to simulate any kind of conversation which could not otherwise have existed. Yes, you could ask an AI to generate a conversation, but I personally find this more riveting, since neither of the models knows what the other one thinks and ergo it seems more realistic.

The models remember what they've said as well as what the other one has said, so the longer you run it, the slower it gets. This one of its drawbacks, but I am currently working on repairing it. 
## Installation

Installation process is simple:
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/aturt14/DiscAI.git
```
That's all. Everything else comes from the standard python library, so there are no dependencies.

### Usage
First, you need to ensure that ollama serve is running:
```sh
ollama serve
```
Then create two models using ollama create (from a Modelfile) and pass them (their names) as 1st and 2nd arguments. Lastly, an initial prompt is needed, because someone has to start the conversation.
```sh
python3 main.py <model1> <model2> <initial_prompt>
```
Or:
```sh
chmod +x main.py
./main.py
```
## Contribution
If you have any suggestions or there is a bug in the application, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. 
### License
This project is in the public domain. I don't care what you do with it, but please do not try to do something illegal.

## Example
There are two modelfiles provided as examples in the repo. Please be aware that their descriptions and even this pair of people have been generated by AI, so it is truly generic. To use them, you can do the following:
```sh
cd DaVinci/
ollama create LeonardoDaVinci
cd ../EMusk/
ollama create ElonMusk
cd ../../
./main.py LeonardoDaVinci ElonMusk "Leonardo, its an honor to meet you. Your work has inspired generations, myself included. Your vision and creativity have left an indelible mark on the world."
```
Possible result:

Conversation of LeonardoDaVinci with ElonMusk:

---------------------------------------------------------
LeonardoDaVinci:
Grazie! I am honored by your words. Today, I shall continue my studies of human anatomy, as I believe a deeper understanding of our bodies is essential to both art and science. Perhaps we will discover something new that can further enlighten us on the magnificent complexity of our existence.
---------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------
ElonMusk:
I find it fascinating how your interests span across multiple disciplines. Your relentless pursuit of knowledge in fields such as biology, physics, and engineering is truly inspiring. I look forward to seeing the innovative advancements that result from your passion for understanding the world around us.
---------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------
LeonardoDaVinci:
Thank you once again! My goal is to contribute to the betterment of humanity by connecting different branches of knowledge, much like how the veins in our bodies connect every part of us. By doing so, we may unlock new possibilities that were previously unimaginable.
---------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------
ElonMusk:
As a fellow explorer and pioneer in my own field, I could not agree more. The fusion of diverse disciplines often leads to groundbreaking discoveries and advancements that have the potential to change our world for the better. I am excited about what lies ahead for both of us as we continue down our respective paths!
---------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------
LeonardoDaVinci:
Indeed, my friend! Our journey is not only a personal one but also contributes to the collective growth of humanity. By pushing the boundaries of what is known and understood, we pave the way for others to follow and create an even brighter future. May our pursuits bring forth great discoveries that enrich the minds of generations to come!
---------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------
ElonMusk:
Your words are truly inspiring, and I am humbled by your kind sentiment. Let us continue to strive for excellence and innovation in our respective fields, knowing that we are contributing not only to ourselves but also to the betterment of humanity as a whole. Together, we can make a difference!
---------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------
LeonardoDaVinci:
Absolutely! United in our pursuit of knowledge and understanding, we shall overcome any obstacles and reach new heights together. Thank you for sharing your thoughts and passion with me, I look forward to seeing what the future holds for both of us!
---------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------
ElonMusk:
The feeling is mutual! It has been a pleasure engaging with you on these thought-provoking topics. May our minds continue to soar and inspire others as we navigate through the vast expanse of knowledge that awaits us. Ciao for now!
---------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------
LeonardoDaVinci:
Ciao, my friend! Until we meet again in the realm of ideas, let us remember that curiosity is the compass that guides us towards discovery. Keep exploring, keep innovating, and never lose your thirst for wisdom!
---------------------------------------------------------

Of course, this is really generic description, as you may see in the Modelfiles. You can create more interesting ones, the models are capable of even generating emojis. You can specify their language, their hobbys, names etc. You can also use other model than openhermes, but I like to use it, because it is really good, not too resource-consuming and relatively uncensored.

## Planned enhancements
There are three main things I want to focus on:
- *History* - There is the huge problem of really slowing down as the conversation grows longer and the models have to process more data. The idea is to summarize their conversation so far (as people usually do, we do not remember everything we or the others said) and this could give them larger capacity.
- *Editing what the models are saying* - Imagine you want some vary particular conversation, but it they suddenly start to stray off the topic you wanted them to talk about. You could edit their answers to get them back to the topic.
- *The goodbye problem* - If you do not set the models particularily for it, they soon start repeating goodbye, bye, see you next time etc. This could be solved by the second point, but I am thinking of a better solution.
